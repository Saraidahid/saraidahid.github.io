  <h1> Travel Blog: Europe</h1>
  <div id="introduction">
    <h2> Background Information </h2>
    <p>Over the summer I traveled through Europe visiting Many countries such as Germany, Czech Republic, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland. All of these countries were each uniqueand had their unique gems.
      I hope to insire people to travel and want to share my experience in Europe! </p>
    <h3> Germany, Berlin</h3>
    <p> For our first country we vissted Germany, staying in each city for two nights and then moving to the next. The first day of Germany we visited Berlin and took a guided tour on the bus. Although the 
      city was beautiful I wish that we could have interacted and explored the city more on the first day. We visited Berlin Wall, and I saw that there were murals on the wall painted from artist all over 
      the world. Additionally, our tour guide was alive when the Berlin Wall was still up, so he provided insight as to how the wall looked like when he was a child compared to now. 
      Germany is a beautiful country, and I wish that I had more time to explore the city since it had so much to offer! </p>
